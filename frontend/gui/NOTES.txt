** IN PACKAGE.JSON **

following data could be found under "scripts"
"dev": "react-scripts start",
"start": "react-scripts start", 
** When running locally use "start"
   Running on Heroku Server change start to "dev"
** Heroku starts with react-scripts would fail to understand react-route
   When changed to dev, it would automatically figure out start scripts
   This could be changed in future by setting up the server-side (node.js)
